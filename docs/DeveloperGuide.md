## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `MentorstackParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MentorstackParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `MentorstackParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `MentorstackParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the mentorstack data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/mentorstack/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both mentorstack data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `MentorstackStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.mentorstack.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The key operation to store the states of the data is in the `Model` interface as `Model#remember()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Mentorstack` will be initialized with the initial mentorstack state, and the empty list of state `history` is initialized.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState0.puml" alt="UndoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the mentorstack. The `delete` command calls `Model#remember()`, causing the original state before the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `history`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState1.puml" alt="UndoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#remember()`, causing another mentorstack state to be saved into the `history`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState2.puml" alt="UndoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#remember()`, so the mentorstack state will not be saved into the `history`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which, after verified by `Model#canUndo()`, will make `history` to pop once to give last state, and restores the mentorstack to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState3.puml" alt="UndoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `history` has no previous mentorstack states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the mentorstack, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#remember()`. Thus, the `history` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoState4.puml" alt="UndoState4" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire mentorstack.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Stats feature
#### Implementation
The `StatsCommand` provides statistical insights into the persons stored in MentorStack. It can either display overall statistics or filter by a specified subject.
#### Execution Flow
* If a subject is specified, filter the list of persons based on that subject.
* Count the number of persons, males, and females in the filtered list.
* Format the results into a string and return as a CommandResult.

<puml src="diagrams/StatsCommandClassDiagram.puml" alt="StatsCommandClassDiagram" />

The following sequence diagram shows how a stats operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/StatsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="StatsSequenceDiagram" />

### Student archiving

The `ArchiveCommand` archives students and transfers their data to an archive list stored on Mentorstack.
It is similar to the active list but student entries cannot be edited.

Given below is a sequence diagram for a sample `ArchiveCommand`

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ArchiveSequenceDiagram" />

A similar sequence diagram can be drawn for the `UnarchiveCommand`, which moves the student back to the active list.
