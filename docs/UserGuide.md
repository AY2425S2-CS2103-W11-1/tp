## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-W11-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Mentorstack.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar mentorstack.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)


1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe g/M p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/CS2103` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Mentorstack.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `[n/NAME] [s/SUBJECT]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/CS2103` or as `n/John Doe` or as `s/CS2103`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SUBJECT]…​` can be used as `s/CS2103`, `s/CS2103 s/LAJ1201` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

**Notes about entries in Mentorstack**:

* Each student entry in Mentorstack must have valid parameters for the following:
  - Name
  - Gender
  - Phone
  - Email
  - Subject


* Students must have 1 or more subjects, each subject can be marked as finished or unfinished.
* Students can be archived, in which case they will be moved to the archive list where they cannot be edited.
* Two student entries are considered the same entry if they have the same Name (case-sensitive).
* Mentorstack does not allow duplicate entries.
  - `Alex Yeoh` is a duplicate of `Alex Yeoh`, but is a different entry from `alex yeoh`.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Mentorstack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Mentorstack home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
