* Mentorstack helps CS tutors efficiently manage and track student contacts, attendance, participation, progress, and streamlines communication.
* It simplifies student management across different levels and courses while catering to tech-savvy users who may prefer a command-line interface (CLI).

* If you are interested in using Mentorstack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Mentorstack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
